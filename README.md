This script implements a deep learning pipeline to predict gene expression levels from epigenomic signal data. It begins by loading and preprocessing training, validation, and test datasetsâ€”merging gene expression values with genomic information and extracting spatial features from BigWig files across several marks (e.g., histone modifications and DNase). These features are scaled and formatted for input into a custom CNN-LSTM model that incorporates spatial weighting via a learnable decay parameter. The model is trained with early stopping based on validation loss and Spearman correlation, and once trained, it is used to generate predictions on test data. Finally, the script saves these predictions to a CSV file and packages them into a ZIP file along with additional project files for submission.
